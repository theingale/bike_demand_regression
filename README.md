# Bike Sharing Demand Regression Analysis for Boom Bikes
We are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

## General Information
- A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free.
- BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19
- They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.
- We are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables.
- It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations.

## Conclusions
From above Multiple Linear Regression Model Analysis we can conclude that

1. Building Multiple Linear Regression is possible on given data
2. We found 10 most important parameters that affect bike sharing demand
3. Feature importance are as plotted above. Temperature and weather status appear to affect the demand the most as per our best model.
4. We achieved best Model using statsmodels OLS with R-Square metric of 0.79 on test data and 0.83 on train data
5. Same model can be used to predict demand in future
